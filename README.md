# sketches

Repository for learning about sketch-based, probabilistic metrics like hyperloglog, bloom filter, etc.

Right now this only holds a talk I gave about how we used HyperLogLog to count distinct things fast & cheap.  I'll add some code in the future as I take time to learn about other such metrics.
